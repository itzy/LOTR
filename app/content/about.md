About WGTOTW
=======

This website is created for the company WGTOTW (We Gonna Take Over The World).
It is a small company with devoted workers, we strive towards a world where Tolkien is basic knowledge, and this is our small contribution to that.
The idea is to ask WHATEVER you want, there are no stupid or boring questions in the world of Tolkien!

We do not tolerate impatience, bad language or insulting other members. Of course there can be disagreements, some will follow Sauron and some
will follow Frodo. Some might neither stand for good nor evil, but respect is key here.

We hope to see this page grow into something big, and that can only be achieved with your help!
So welcome, to the wonderful mystery that is **the Lord of the Rings**.

About Julia Sivartsson

Hi everyone!
I'm currently a student at BTH (Blekinge Tekniska Högskola) where I'm achieving my dream to become a webdeveloper.
It is long hours and hard work, just staring into a screen. But the reward of seeing your webpage online is priceless!

So, this is my project for my last course, MVC.
I chose this page to be about LOTR because ... well, that's something I know very well so it came very naturally to me.

Some info about me, I'm a girl (just turning 24) who lives in Växjö in my own apartment with my beautiful baby dragon (bearded dragon), Alastair.
I spend most of my time at the computer, watching series/movies, developing webpages, photoshop or gameing. I'm a nerd, yes.
I like to work out also, which might be good for me since all my other time is spent in my chair ;) I looove the gym, running and zumba.

Anyway, that was a little about me.

Don't forget to register ;)
