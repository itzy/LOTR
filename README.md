INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS
==========

First, get your own version of [itzy/LOTR](https://github.com/itzy/LOTR)

You need to edit config_mysql.php "app/config/" so that it has your own database information.
Edit header and footer in "app/view/me/" as you like.
Edit index.md and about.md in "app/content/".

If you want to add controllers, just go to "src/DI/CDIFactoryDefault" where you can find the existing controllers and add your own.

I have also implemented my own plugin for Anax-MVC [itzy/flash](https://github.com/itzy/flash)which you are free to use as you like, check out its page for instructions on how to use it. 


That's it!
