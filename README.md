INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS
==========

First, get your own version of https://github.com/itzy/LOTR

You need to edit config_mysql.php "app/config/" so that it has your own database information.
Edit header and footer in "app/view/me/" as you like.
Edit index.md and about.md in "app/content/"

That's it!
